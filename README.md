# RWC_predictor
This repo contains code for a neural network which predicts the scores of Rugby World Cup matches. The [RWC_Score_Predictor_AI.ipynb](https://github.com/jeanweinmann/RWC_predictor/blob/main/RWC_Score_Predictor_AI.ipynb) file details the process I followed to acheive the results I did.
